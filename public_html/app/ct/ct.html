                <p class="text-header left-align">MY ROLE</p>
                <p class="text">I was approached by the shared IT services team, aka CoreTech, to conduct user testing on the beta version of their shared IT services catalog site. Based on the results of the first round of testing my engagement in this project expanded to include creating an alternative design, conducting A/B testing and helping to set the overall design direction. </p>

                
                 <p class="sub-header">EXPERIENCE STRATEGY &amp; VISION</p>
                <p class="text">I created an alternative design based on the results of user testing I conducted on CoreTech’s beta design. Through these artifacts I was able to share with the CoreTech team a visualization of the users needs and conduct A/B testing.</p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">USER TESTING</p>
                <p class="text">Using personas developed by the CoreTech team I created a user testing kit where I asked participants to solve a series of scenarios based on the persona they most closely reflected. After translating these results into takeaways for CoreTech I was able create suggestions on how they could improve their experience. </p>

                <p class="text">Working with the client, CoreTech, I advocated for the user based on the results of my testing to ensure user’s needs would be met and balanced those needs with business requirements.  Through the results of my testing I was able to provide valuable guidance which helped the CoreTech prioritize their roadmap in order to meet their user’s highest impact needs first. </p>
                
                <p class="sub-header">A/B Testing</p>
                <p class="text">Based on the results of the first round of User Testing I conducted I created an alternative design to the CoreTech Beta mockup.  I then devised a A/B test that would help us determine which design direction best met the users needs by creating a series of scenarios based on our users goals for test participants to complete using each of the designs. </p>

                <p class="text">My challenge was to help CoreTech create a solution that would streamline the process of acquiring IT services in GE and empower GE employees to make product and service acquisition decisions on their own.  In order to do this I needed to understand how the process had traditionally worked and to empathize with users in a way that I could truly understand their experience when interacting with IT shared services.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">That interaction was a very complex and time intensive process that required a lot of “tribal knowledge” in order to complete. IT shared services was spread out across many different portals which utilized different processes and designs. Additionally there were very few products and services that could actually be obtained without requiring some form of person-to-person interaction. Even more challenging for employees was understanding how each of their products and services related to one another and how those dependences would affect the solution they were trying to build.  </p>

                <p class="text">I was originally only brought into this project to conduct a single round of usability testing on the beta version of CoreTech’s shared IT services site.  However, the results of that round of testing suggested that substantial changes needed to be made to the information architecture strategy and the goals the project was striving to achieve.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Based on my recommendations the CoreTech team agreed to my proposal to improve their own Beta design while I explored a different direction for the project with a mockup created in Axure. Once both were ready I would conduct a second round of usability testing to evaluate if 1) The changes to the beta design were successful in addressing the shortcomings identified in the first round of testing and 2) if an alternative direction, as represented in my mockup, would more effectively meet users needs. </p>
                                
                
                <p class="sub-header">OPEN COMMUNICATION</p>
                <p class="text">Building an alternative design meant becoming more than just a Usability Testing Consultant.  I was potentially producing a design that would drastically change the direction of already well established project should my alternative direction prove to be far more effective than the current approach.  As a result it became imperative that I maintained a high level of transparency and communication around the work that I was doing in order to create a strong working dynamic.</p>
                
                
                <p class="sub-header">BUILDING TRUST AND AWARENESS</p>
                <p class="text">UX testing, research and design is a fairly new addition within GE, so any project that I was involved with while at GE always included a lot of evangelizing. That was particularly true during my time with CoreTech as it was a very politically charged project with a lot of stakeholders who had a personal stake in the project’s outcome. As a result my goal became to keep the focus of all the stakeholders on the user’s and what they would need in order to be successful when interacting with CoreTech.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">Thankfully I already had years of experience working within GE’s culture which I could use in order to communicate the results of my research in a way which stakeholders could relate too.  The legacy culture at GE was still very focused on quantitative results and while UX does not always yield very clear cut percentage-based results I did my best to represent my results in terms of a percentage of users who were successful at meeting the goals all of the stakeholders had agreed on for the project.</p>

                <p class="text">Discovery research was run by an external contractor who conducted research interviews with a collection of different employees at GE and then created detailed user personas based on those results.  I was given the results of their research and a copy of their personas to use as my discovery for my portion of this project as well.</p>
                
                <p class="text">The personas and research results were very well done and provided great insight into the needs, motivations and pain-points of CoreTech’s audience. As a matter of fact I was surprised to see how much of a disconnect between the insights shown in the personas and the actual design there was. It appeared as the though the design had been created without taking any guidance from the researched conducted. </p>
                
                <p class="text">At a high level, the research showed that the audience had three shared goals 1) to have a self-service shared IT services site 2) to have one unified location for all shared IT services information and 3) to be able to see the roadmap for products and services.</p>

In order to make this evaluation I decided to take break the goals down by persona.

Given this, I believed I might be able to design a better process if I took a step back and considered the entire journey each persona traveled while using a CoreTech product or service.</p>
                
                <p class="text">To help me organize and visualize these journeys I created experience maps for each of the primary personas.  This helped me to identify the user’s pain-points and opportunities to make the design architecture fit the way users research, obtain and use CoreTech product and services.  </p>

                <p class="text">Using the experience maps and the usability test feedback I was able to recognize that users did not visit CoreTech to find a specific product, but that they were motivated to visit by the need to find a solution to a problem.  As a result I thought it would make more sense to organize the site by solutions and the collection of product and services that would make up the typical solution to that problem.  For example instead of listing servers, databases and VM software, simply list a Web Application Hosting solution. </p>
                
                <p class="text last">In addition I wanted to recreate the design to make actionable information more predominant in the site and display that content in a way which is more relatable to the user.  For example on the homepage I switched out an aesthetically pleasing image of GE windmills for a simple infographic showing the core services offered through the site.  </p>

                <p class="text">When creating my alternative design I focused on several high level principles that would separate it from the beta site design: 1) Expose actionable content on high level pages  2) re-architect to simplify navigation 3) focus on solutions, not products  4) limit the amount of text and increase white space to improve scannability.

The high level takeaway from the A/B test was that my alternative design (referred to as Design B) did a better job at meeting users expectations for their interaction CoreTech.  Users of Design B were able identify with the content of the site and navigate it intuitively compared to the beta site (referred to as the Current CoreTech Design). However, the feedback suggested that my alternative design did not go far enough to push solutions over products.</p>
