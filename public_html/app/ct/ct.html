                <p class="text">I was approached by the shared IT services team, aka CoreTech, to conduct user testing on the beta version of their shared IT services catalog site. Based on the results of the first round of testing my engagement in this project expanded to include creating an alternative design, conducting A/B testing and helping to set the overall design direction. </p>

                
                 <p class="sub-header">EXPERIENCE STRATEGY &amp; VISION</p>
                <p class="text">I created an alternative design based on the results of user testing I conducted on CoreTech’s beta design. Through these artifacts I was able to share with the CoreTech team a visualization of the users needs and conduct A/B testing.</p>

                <p class="text">Using personas developed by the CoreTech team I created a user testing kit where I asked participants to solve a series of scenarios based on the persona they most closely reflected. After translating these results into takeaways for CoreTech I was able create suggestions on how they could improve their experience. </p>

Through the results of my testing I was able to provide valuable guidance which helped the CoreTech prioritize their roadmap in order to meet their user’s highest impact needs first. </p>

                <p class="text">My challenge was to help CoreTech create a solution that would streamline the process of acquiring IT services in GE and empower GE employees to make product and service acquisition decisions on their own.  In order to do this I needed to understand how the process had traditionally worked and to empathize with users in a way that I could truly understand their experience when interacting with IT shared services.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">That interaction was a very complex and time intensive process that required a lot of “tribal knowledge” in order to complete. IT shared services was spread out across many different portals which utilized different processes and designs. Additionally there were very few products and services that could actually be obtained without requiring some form of person-to-person interaction. Even more challenging for employees was understanding how each of their products and services related to one another and how those dependences would affect the solution they were trying to build.  </p>

                <p class="text">I was originally only brought into this project to conduct a single round of usability testing on the beta version of CoreTech’s shared IT services site.  However, the results of that round of testing suggested that substantial changes needed to be made to the information architecture strategy and the goals the project was striving to achieve.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Based on my recommendations the CoreTech team agreed to my proposal to improve their own Beta design while I explored a different direction for the project with a mockup created in Axure. Once both were ready I would conduct a second round of usability testing to evaluate if 1) The changes to the beta design were successful in addressing the shortcomings identified in the first round of testing and 2) if an alternative direction, as represented in my mockup, would more effectively meet users needs. </p>
                                
                
                <p class="sub-header">OPEN COMMUNICATION</p>
                <p class="text">Building an alternative design meant becoming more than just a Usability Testing Consultant.  I was potentially producing a design that would drastically change the direction of already well established project should my alternative direction prove to be far more effective than the current approach.  As a result it became imperative that I maintained a high level of transparency and communication around the work that I was doing in order to create a strong working dynamic.</p>
                
                
                <p class="sub-header">BUILDING TRUST AND AWARENESS</p>
                <p class="text">UX testing, research and design is a fairly new addition within GE, so any project that I was involved with while at GE always included a lot of evangelizing. That was particularly true during my time with CoreTech as it was a very politically charged project with a lot of stakeholders who had a personal stake in the project’s outcome. As a result my goal became to keep the focus of all the stakeholders on the user’s and what they would need in order to be successful when interacting with CoreTech.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">Thankfully I already had years of experience working within GE’s culture which I could use in order to communicate the results of my research in a way which stakeholders could relate too.  The legacy culture at GE was still very focused on quantitative results and while UX does not always yield very clear cut percentage-based results I did my best to represent my results in terms of a percentage of users who were successful at meeting the goals all of the stakeholders had agreed on for the project.</p>

                <p class="text">Discovery research was run by an external contractor who conducted research interviews with a collection of different employees at GE and then created detailed user personas based on those results.  I was given the results of their research and a copy of their personas to use as my discovery for my portion of this project as well.</p>
                
                <p class="text">The personas and research results were very well done and provided great insight into the needs, motivations and pain-points of CoreTech’s audience. As a matter of fact I was surprised to see how much of a disconnect between the insights shown in the personas and the actual design there was. It appeared as the though the design had been created without taking any guidance from the researched conducted. </p>
                
                <p class="text">At a high level, the research showed that the audience had three shared goals 1) to have a self-service shared IT services site 2) to have one unified location for all shared IT services information and 3) to be able to see the roadmap for products and services.</p>

                <p class="sub-header">A MOVING TARGET</p>
                <p class="text">While conducting Discovery there were two major challenges I had to overcome.  The first was that we didn't have enough time for a true Design Sprint, so Discovery had to be done on the fly each sprint.  The second was that we were actually designing ahead of the client.  That is to say we were designing a system to handle data that actually didn't exist yet. </p>
                
                <p class="text">This ended up proving to be the most difficult challenge as we were never able to get a clear picture of the type of data would be once it did exist.  To compensate for this I worked with the client to create design outcomes that they agreed to for each of our personas. Working toward achieving these agreed upon outcomes helped the entire team understand the direction the project should be heading in each sprint.  We constantly referred to these outcomes to drive functionality, direction and prioritization conversations. </p>
                
                <p class="text">To help the team prioritize we worked with the client to identify many different personas who would be relying on our application in one way or another. After we created the different personas we were able to prioritize who we would focus on for each epic. For the phase that I was involved in we focused mostly on Auggie and Tammy.</p>

Auggie needed to be able to quickly find the root cause of a specific issue and then see if it had been repeated in other cases.  Frank needed to quickly find out who was driving what route and what state their AV was in. Dan needed to know the results of a test in order to track the program's success over time in order to prioritize the roadmap. </p>
                
                <p class="text">Focusing on these motivations when approaching the design for our solution helped to give me the perspective I needed to make any users interaction, quick and effective.

This meant that I could iterate my designs each sprint to test out future functionality in support of that vision with relative ease. </p>
                
                <p class="text">The result was a quick moving, but validated approach to designing a complex technical solution within the confines of a tight timeline. I was proud of this approach because it did not sacrifice user feedback for the benefits of speed.</p>

Keeping with that convention I designed a simple, but powerful homepage that allows for easy access to personalization and advanced features, but most importantly allows users to start searching quickly.</p>

The Advanced Search page let's users build their query by "and-ing", "or-ing" or "not-ing" together a series of search tags.  Favorited queries can be accessed quickly from the users profile and an estimated search result count is displayed to improve query result accuracy.</p>

                <p class="text">This project was short, but in that time we managed to accomplish a great deal.  Using an iterative design-thinking approach we were able to unify the client, development team and project management around a single vision for the future of this application as the functionality behind it becomes available. By focusing on the users and their unmet needs we were able to create an application that increases working efficiency and morale.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">At the same time we were able to make sure we never took the user out of user experience.  Using a rigorous testing cycle we were able to confidently deliver a product for a client that for which we had validation it would meet their users needs.  This project was fast and furious, but very successful from start to finish.</p>
