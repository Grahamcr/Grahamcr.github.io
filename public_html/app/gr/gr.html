            <p class="hero-description">In 2016 GE launched an effort to transform itself into a digital industrial company, with aspirations of becoming the AWS for the industrial IOT. This is the story of how I helped GE attract and hire the smart-creative engineers leading that transformation today.</p>

                <p class="text">This project's primary objective was to - define and design an entry level talent recruitment program to help GE Digital attract "Smart, Creative Engineers" who will transform GE into a Digital Industrial Company.</p>
                
                <p class="text">GE Digital recognized that it was having difficulty hiring talented young professionals who were opting to work for companies such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon which are seen as more exciting, leading edge, creative and innovation focused.  As a result I was asked to help GE Digital re-brand itself and spread awareness of it's unique career opportunities through a entry level talent recruitment program, to be called GhostRed. </p>

                <p class="section-title left-align">the approach</p>
                <p class="text-header left-align">PLAY THE LONG GAME</p>
                <p class="text">For most a successful recruitment program is judged by its short-term ability to translate candidate interest into successful hires. Based on my research I was able to stress that the long-term ability of a recruitment program to make a positive impression on a community of promising talent is more valuable than successfully hiring a few candidates quickly. </p>
                
                <p class="text">Therefore, to differentiate ourselves in an already mature and competitive recruitment environment we needed to focus on meeting the needs of our primary users in new, creative and beneficial ways. This opened up the exciting opportunity to truly understand how entry level tech talent made employment decisions and how we could create a program to emphasize with that process. </p>
                
                <p class="sub-header">DISTIBUTED TEAM APPROACH</p>
                <p class="text">The project team was comprised of a Technical Project Manager, a Business Owner, a Full Stack Developer and myself, the UX architect and Visual Designer.  Given we were disbursed across three states we established team norms early on to help us work together effectively and to ensure we maintained communication. We opted for an Agile/Kanban project management strategy with one week "sprints" (quotes here because true Kanban doesn't have sprints, but we found weekly ceremonies beneficial). </p> 
                
                <p class="sub-header">GRAND VISION, ITERATIVE DESIGN</p>
                <p class="text">My design approach for this project was to run a discovery sprint, followed by weekly design sprints.  The output of the discovery sprint was all of my research and a /"Grand Vision/" mockup, showcasing the direction for the design.  This was an opportunity to unify the team around a single design vision and help everyone gain empathy for our users through user research.  Each subsequent design sprint after the discovery sprint mocked what development would create for the next sprint. This iterative approach allowed me to test the the finer points of the design once the grand vision was established. </p> 
                
                <p class="sub-header">TRANSFORMATION AND TRUST</p>
                <p class="text last">Sharing our methods and thinking from the outset helped to foster a strong stakeholder relationship. This was particularly valuable for UX Research as it gave the stakeholders the insight they needed to really empathize with our users and become advocates for there specific needs, goals and motivations. This strong relationship with stakeholders also helped us to understand their business challenges.  Together we identified risks and came to a consensus on expectations for the program. </p>

                <p class="text">My Discovery Research focused on gaining empathy for each of the personas which would be impacted by our solution.  To gain this insight I conducted phone and in-person interviews with high school & college students, recruiters, hiring managers and entry level talent at GE and other companies.</p>
                
                <p class="text">These interviews were very conversational and open-ended to ensure the participants felt they had the opportunity to tell me everything they felt was most important. The outcome of these interviews was enough research that I could create validated personas to drive our program direction and design.</p>

                <p class="text">I designed these mock-ups to purposefully be polar opposites of one another to ensure I would get clear results out of my design assessments.  The assumption was that the "winning" design would be a combination of features from each of the initial designs. </p>

                <p class="text">Once I had developed the two high level designs for my design experiment, I created a test kit based on the goals and motivations of the primary personas. The A/B Usability Test kit included a set of open-end scenarios related to the goals of the persona the participant most closely reflects. This approach leads to more insightful feedback as it places the participant in real world situations without scripted directions detailing how to interact with the application to achieve their goal.  Instead it more accurately reflects how a user is likely to interact with the site once it goes live. </p>

From the results I was able to determine not only a direction for the look and feel of the site, but also the information users found most impactful when deciding to engage/participate in GhostRed.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Even more profound what that the way the test was structured allowed us to break down that feedback by persona type, making prioritization based on the section of our audience we felt was most important to reach a simpler task. </p>

                <p class="text">Looking back at the A/B Usability Test and the results, I should have kept the Axure mock-ups at a lower fidelity, with high fidelity homepages.  This would have provided several benefits: First, it would have allowed the test participants to focus more on the information presented, navigation scheme, etc without being distracted by the aesthetics of the site. Second, it might have encouraged additional feedback as the site would have looked less complete, giving participants the feel that their feedback would have a greater impact on the direction of the site as it wasn't as far along. Finally, the homepage would have been a large enough sample of the look and feel to get customer's feedback on that particular design direction. </p>

                <p class="text">Understanding the context of how different users would be interacting with our app from the results of the A/B Usability Test helped me develop a clear vision of the tonal expectations of our potential users. From this information we were able to develop a set of guiding brand principles we wanted our presence to embody. These principles were used (and still are today) to drive the aesthetic, feel, look and tone of the app.</p>

                    <p class="text">I also needed to focus on providing multiple navigation routes to important information that would help users make decisions.

                    <p class="text">Axure proved to be the best tool of choice for prototyping because of its ability to create high-fidelity, click-able, and responsive (adaptive view) mock-ups. Using Axure I was able to translate our guiding brand principles and the design direction into a final iteration mock-up that I took through another round of Usability Testing. I also created a style guide for the development team to reference and a asset library of all the graphics I had created.</p>

                    <p class="text">The results of that Usability Testing round suggested that only minor tweaks were needed to the content and design.  After I made those changes I created one more mock to serve as our Sprint One mock-up. For each sprint I created a new mock-up showing the functionality that should be added for that sprint.  I typically stayed one to two weeks ahead of the development team to leave adequate time for development/testing.  </p>
