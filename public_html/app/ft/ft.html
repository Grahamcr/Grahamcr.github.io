                <p class="text-header left-align">MY ROLE</p>
                <p class="text">I had the opportunity to conduct research into how GE employees obtained the information they needed in order to carry out their daily responsibilities at GE and then ideate a solution that would make that process more enjoyable and efficient.  I independently conducted the research, ideation and testing myself and produced all of the artifacts shown in this case study. </p>

                <p class="sub-header">CONTEXTUAL RESEARCH INTERVIEWS</p>
                <p class="text">It was common knowledge at GE that specific information, such as a certain form or application was difficult to find on the intranet.  However, what  wasn’t common knowledge was how different employees sought out that information, utilized it and produced it for others to find. Insight into those areas and more was what allowed me to create a solution users loved.</p>
                
                 <p class="sub-header">PERSONA DEVELOPMENT</p>
                <p class="text">Personas became a powerful tool when solving this problem because it helped me to identify that each member of the audience was looking to solve the same core problem, even if that need came from a different motivation. That insight helped me to create a solution that was intuitive and useful to the broadest audience possible. </p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">A/B TESTING</p>
                <p class="text">The discovery phase suggested that there were two equally justifiable solutions to the challenge of finding information within GE: 1) Telling the user as much as we possibly know about their query in an organized fashion or 2) Give them the contact information of the person who is most likely to know the answer to their query.  In order to find out which was most helpful in the majority of circumstances I developed a multivariate A/B test.</p>

                <p class="text">As UX Subject Matter Expert of the Innovation Studio Way Project Accelerator I had the opportunity to help other team’s leverage their unique skill sets to create amazing products that would improve the employee experience at GE.  One such team had created an algorithm that was particularly good at taking input and creating fuzzy matches between instances within data.  It was an awesomely powerful tool, but it didn’t have much of a purpose at the time within GE.  Therefore, the team started to wonder if they could use this approach to improve the way that information was found in GE. </p>
                
                <p class="text">That question is where I came in.  I was asked to research how employees were finding the information they needed to do their everyday jobs at GE and discover if there was a way that this team could make it better using their fuzzy matching algorithm. </p>
                
                <p class="text">I started by conducting open-ended contextual inquiry research with a variety of employees around the company in order to empathize with the challenges employees faced when trying to locate valuable information on GE’s Intranet.  </p>

                <p class="text">Discovery was run as a multiple week sprint where I conducted contextual inquiry interviews with prospective users and developed personas based on the research results. The magnitude of how much people were struggling to find information was incredible with employees reporting spending two or three hours a day looking for information with only a 50% success rate of finding the information they needed.  </p>
                
                <p class="text">What was interesting was that there were several common trends across the results, which suggested that the system which was currently in place at GE was not supporting the way employees actually worked. These insights helped to shape the direction a new solution could take to empower users to find information the way they want. </p>

                <p class="text">While analyzing the contextual inquiry interview results I started to see that most queries could be generalized into two different buckets. The first was someone looking for “a starting point to an engagement” and the second, someone looking for “the person who knows X”.  Given this I was able to create two primary personas, one for each case and one secondary persona to guide the design direction going forward.</p>

                <p class="text">In order to answer this question I developed two deep interaction mockups using Axure and developed a scenario based usability test where I asked participants to independently complete a series of open-ended real life scenarios using each the mockups.

The search box is big, because employees typically know a lot about what they are looking for and users want to put more effort in up front by typing in longer quries rather than taking the effort later to scan through unrelvant results.  Additionally, the more information the algorithm gets the more accurate its answer will be. The results page organizes a variety of information in a consistent and scannable way which enables the user to understand their results and then quickly take action.  </p>
