            <p class="hero-description">One of the biggest challenges of running a technology consultancy is managing employees as projects are won, lost, start and end. This is the story of how I designed an application to help leadership create different employee assignment scenarios to predict how winning or losing projects would affect the workforce. </p>

                <p class="text-header left-align">MY ROLE</p>
                <p class="text">To help a technology consultancy company prepare for multiple possible contract win/loss scenarios I was asked to digitize a process they were currently doing with long-running sticky notes. To discover the most effective design I ran very rapid design and test iterations where I tested a new design with users every one to two days over the course of 10 days. </p>

                <p class="sub-header">MIND MAPPING</p>
                <p class="text">This project had to be completed on an extremely tight timeline of less than three weeks, so there was little time to run a proper discovery sprint.  Therefore I ran a mind mapping session with the project stakeholders to get a understanding the challenge, audience and business requirements.</p>
                
                 <p class="sub-header">RAPID PROTOTYPING</p>
                <p class="text">Since there was little time for discovery it was critical to maintain even more frequent than normal user feedback during the design process. To facilitate this I took a rapid prototyping where I produced a new mockup or A/B test every couple of days based on the usability results from the previous iteration.</p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">A/B TESTING</p>
                <p class="text">Getting the Information Architecture right was very important to the client.  To test out different approaches to structuring the data I designed a couple different multivariate A/B tests to determine which approach would be the most intuitive to users.</p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">HIGH FIDELITY DESIGN &amp; STYLE GUIDE</p>
                <p class="text">Once a design direction had been settled on based on the results of the Rapid Prototyping and User Testing I created a High Fidelity Click-Through Mockup using Axure which showed all the expected interactions, tone and aesthetics. </p>

                <p class="text-header left-align">A High Impact Technology Team</p>
                <p class="text">A technology consultancy company approached me to help them improve the design of an application they were working on to digitize possible workforce allocation scenarios based on the projects they had bids out for and were currently working. The timeframe to complete this design was very short, only three weeks, as the developers who would be working on implementing the design were doing the work as a bench project. </p>
                
                <p class="text">The goal was to create an application that would allow leadership to both view how the company's workforce was currently allocated and also create plans to allocate the workforce in differently to account for different possible scenarios, such as winning a new large contract.  In the future the stakeholders also wanted to add intelligence to the solution so that it could use metadata about employees, such as their home address, previous projects and skill levels to suggest the optimal allocation of employees given a specific scenario. </p>

                <p class="text-header left-align">THE WAR-ROOM APPROACH</p>
                <p class="text">Three weeks to develop a complete design and style guide for a complex application was not a lot of time. Therefore instead of running a dedicated discovery sprint, I opted for a rapid prototyping approach were the first iteration would be informed by the results of a Mind Mapping session. </p>
                
                <p class="text">I was able to get all of the stakeholders and some leadership to join together for an afternoon that we spent talking through the user's needs, motivations and goals, as well as, the business requirements that would have to be met.  The result was an artifact that provided insight into the application’s audience and the functionality that would be required in order for the design to be successful.</p>

                <p class="text">For this application to be a success it had to be faster to use than manually manipulating sticky notes on a whiteboard and taking pictures of different employee/team configurations.  This is a surprisingly high bar to overcome as users can quickly modify sticky notes and the barrier of taking a picture isn’t actually that high. Therefore, I needed to make sure that I was able to present content and functionality in a way that was highly intuitive.</p>
                
                <p class="text">To discover the perfect information architecture I conducted multivariate A/B tests like the one below that tests a vertical vs. horizontal layout and list vs. tabbed scenario access.  Multivariate tests rarely give results that point to one pure solution over the other so my next iteration was typically a combination of features from both designs.  </p>

                <p class="text">My plan to compensate for the tight timeline was to put meaningful designs in front of the user and conduct scenario based usability tests as frequently as reasonably possible. This approach turned out to be very successful as it provided the user with real world scenarios to test the wireframes with and it gave myself ample opportunities to validate that the design was heading in the right direction. </p>
