                    <p class="title">ABOUT ME</p>

                    <p class="content">I am thankful to have a diverse background that I leverage to empathize with a wide variety of users and effectively advocate for them no matter if the situation requires that I need to be a consultant, researcher, subject matter specialist or something else.  My speciality is Agile and UX transformation projects, where the goal is not only to create delightful, effective applications, but also help traditionally waterfall teams see the benefits of Agile and UX practices. </p>

                    <p class="content">I further believe that UX shouldn’t be confined to a screen and that is beneficial to take a step back and consider the entire experience of a user beyond the pixels they will manipulate. The principles of design thinking and design sprints can be applied to even larger strategic challenges, such as product direction, customer perception and more. I believe that at is core the goal of UX is to improve the lives of others, whether it be through software, physical design or strategic vision.</p>

                    <p class="content">I started my career very technical, first as a full stack developer for the National Security Agency and then as a front-end developer for GE Aviation.  I then spent two years helping to create GE Digital’s Startup Incubator, The Innovation Studio Way, where I served as the UX subject matter expert helping GE make wise decisions on which projects to invest in and helping those product teams be successful.  Currently I am a UX Architect with the consulting firm Pillar Technology, where I work side-by-side with client teams on UX transformation projects. </p>
