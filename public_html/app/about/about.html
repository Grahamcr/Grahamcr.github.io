                    <p class="title">ABOUT CRAIG</p>

                    <p class="content">Craig has earned a reputation as a positive, can-do attitude who is not only willing to learn something new, but loves to do so. His reputation is not the result of happenstance, instead it has been crafted over years of technical and design experience working as part of small "start-up" mindset teams.</p>

                    <p class="content">For Craig, UX is more than just a job.  For him, it is an opportunity to make a positive difference in the world around him.  He believes that UX shouldn't be confined to cyberspace. The process of conducting UX studies and UX's core principles can be applied to far broader problem set.  Throughout his career Craig has had the opportunity to do just that and hopefully make a positive difference in the lives of those who interact with solutions Craig has been a part of creating.</p>

                    <p class="content">Craig is a Computer Science graduate of Grand Valley State University who believes in technology as an opportunity to improve the lives of others. He helped to set up GE Digital's Startup Incubator, The Innovation Studio Way, and served as its UX subject matter expert. He was also part of GE's RISE leadership program, a leadership acceleration program for GE's top 1% performers. Previously Craig was a Front-End Developer and designer for GE Aviation, a Full-Stack Developer for Booz Allen Hamilton and a Cooperative Education Student at the National Security Agency (NSA).</p>
