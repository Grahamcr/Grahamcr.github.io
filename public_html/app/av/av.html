                <p class="text">The space race of our generation: Self-Driving Cars, also known as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).  Almost every car maker is developing some level of autonomy into their current and future models.  With safety and reliability being of the highest concern for customers, politicians and auto makers alike, robust testing and debugging has also risen in priority.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Our challenge was to help a major auto maker develop a application to enable Algorithm Developers to quickly locate the date they need to debug issues in the machine learning code that navigates AVs. Additionally we need to develop a way to observe the AV testing fleet in real time so that Fleet Managers, Testers, and Algorithm Developers could make observations and/or take action while an AV was operational.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Developers were currently combing multiple sources of data by hand.  Fleet Managers were communicating with Test Drivers using cell phones to receive updates.  With the new application we were creating we could drastically reduce development time and ease safety concerns.</p>

                <p class="text-header left-align">FAST AND DELIBERATE</p>
                <p class="text">Creating the first Autonomous Vehicle ready for mass production is a race, and so was our project.  We had a very tight schedule that didn't even leave us enough time for a dedication Sprint 0 or Design Sprint.  Instead we had to run Sprint 0 and our discovery research at the same time in order to meet the demands of the development schedule.</p>
                
                <p class="text">This meant working quickly to understand stakeholder needs and prioritize them so that the development team had a clear direction, even if there weren't visuals to support it. Once I did have visuals created, I iterated quickly and stayed a week ahead of the development team with my mockups.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-header">RUNNING DISCOVERY AND ITERATIVE MOCKUPS</p>
                <p class="text">In order to ensure that we had a validated design direction to work from each sprint I would run a "mini design sprint" each week with the output being a iterative mockup the development team would work from.  In sprint planning the project managers, stakeholders, business owners and myself would prioritize functionality to be researched, designed and tested this week.</p>
                
                <p class="text">In order for this approach to be successful on such a limited time table it required that I have almost unlimited high-priority access to the client in order to interview and usability test with users.</p>
                
                
                <p class="sub-header">OPEN, HONEST AND DIRECT</p>
                <p class="text last">Our best tactic for dealing with the tight timeline was a very transparent approach to the work that we were doing.  This approach helped us establish a trusting relationship with the client where they always new what we were working on and more importantly why.  It also gave us the opportunity to know the business requirements better and adequately address them in our own process.</p>

                <p class="text">The discovery phase of each sprint was always a quick, high-intensity effort to understand our client's vision for our work and our users needs in order to be successful. The research I conducted revealed that while each of the users were working to build the  same solution, they rarely interacted with one another and had vastly different needs.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Users motivations for interacting with our system would therefore be very different for each of our users in our audience. This suggested that we would have very different requirements for each of our different personas.</p>
                
                <p class="text">To help the team prioritize we worked with the client to identify many different personas who would be relying on our application in one way or another. After we created the different personas we were able to prioritize who we would focus on for each epic. For the phase that I was involved in we focused mostly on Auggie and Tammy.</p>

                <p class="text">While conducting Discovery there were two major challenges I had to overcome.  The first was that we didn't have enough time for a true Design Sprint, so Discovery had to be done on the fly each sprint.  The second was that we were actually designing ahead of the client.  That is to say we were designing a system to handle data that actually didn't exist yet. </p>
                
                <p class="text">This ended up proving to be the most difficult challenge as we were never able to get a clear picture of the type of data would be once it did exist.  To compensate for this I worked with the client to create design outcomes that they agreed too for each of our personas. Working toward achieving these agreed upon outcomes helped the entire team understand the direction the project should be heading in each sprint.  We constantly refereed to these outcomes to drive functionality, direction and prioritization conversations. </p>

                <p class="text">In every aspect of my research one thing was consistently emphasized, speed and not just in a technical sense, but also from a information architecture perspective.  Auggie needed to be able to quickly find the root cause of a specific issue and then see if it had been repeated in other cases.  Frank needed to quickly find out who was driving what route and what state their AV was in. Dan needed to know the results of a test in order to track the program's success over time in order to prioritize the roadmap. </p>
                
                <p class="text">Focusing on these motivations when approaching the design for our solution helped to give me the perspective I needed to make any users interaction, quick and effective.  To help myself build this perspective further I composed a set of user stories for each persona based on my research findings.</p>

                <p class="text">Having validated Storyboard, Personas and User Stories meant that the client, the development team and myself all had an agreed upon shared vision for our application.  This meant that I could iterate my designs each sprint to test out future functionality in support of that vision with relative ease. </p>
                
                <p class="text">The result was a quick moving, but validated approach to designing a complex technical solution within the confines of a tight timeline. I was proud of this approach because it did not sacrifice user feedback for the benefits of speed.</p>

The Advanced Search page let's users build their query by "and-ing", "or-ing" or "not-ing" together a series of search tags.  Favorited queries can be accessed quickly from the users profile and an estimated search result count is displayed to improve query result accuracy.</p>

Using an iterative design-thinking approach we were able to unify the client, development team and project management around a single vision for the future of this application as the functionality behind it becomes available. By focusing on the users and their unmet needs we were able to create an application that increases working efficiency and morale.</p>
                
                <p class="text last">At the same time we were able to make sure we never took the user out of user experience.  Using a rigorous testing cycle we were able to confidently deliver a product for a client that for which we had validation it would meet their users needs.  This project was fast and furious, but very successful from start to finish.</p>
