                <p class="text-header left-align">MY ROLE</p>
                <p class="text">I took over this project from another UX Researcher as the project just started to enter its second phase. I independently produced and tested all the major deliverables and presented to the project stakeholders.  The research I conducted helped to define the project scope and direction.</p>

                <p class="sub-header">CUSTOMER INSIGHTS &amp; IDEATION</p>
                <p class="text">Through research I uncovered insights and translated concepts into features that addressed customer goals and motivations. The ideation sessions I conducted produced the feature set we prioritized as a team.</p>
                
                 <p class="sub-header">EXPERIENCE STRATEGY &amp; VISION</p>
                <p class="text">I created prototypes to share the vision, design principles and content strategy.  Through these artifacts and their presentation I helped to evangelize ideas and form consensus around a design direction</p>

                <p class="text">I conducted research interviews with individuals representing a variety of domain skills and translated those interviews into user goals.  From those goals I was able to derive functionality and advocate for the user in prioritization discussions.</p>

                <p class="text">The space race of our generation: Self-Driving Cars, also known as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).  Almost every car maker is developing some level of autonomy into their current and future models.  With safety and reliability being of the highest concern for customers, politicians and auto makers alike, robust testing and debugging has also risen in priority.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Our challenge was to help a major auto maker develop a application to enable Algorithm Developers to quickly locate the date they need to debug issues in the machine learning code that navigates AVs. Additionally we need to develop a way to observe the AV testing fleet in real time so that Fleet Managers, Testers, and Algorithm Developers could make observations and/or take action while an AV was operational.</p>
                
                <p class="text">Developers were currently combing multiple sources of data by hand.  Fleet Managers were communicating with Test Drivers using cell phones to receive updates.  With the new application we were creating we could drastically reduce development time and ease safety concerns.</p>
