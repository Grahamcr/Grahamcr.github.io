            <p class="hero-description">In 2015 GE Digital launched an internal project accelerator team which I joined as the UX Subject Matter Expert.  This is the story of how I helped that team establish its identity, develop an effective agile process and market itself to the company. </p>

                <p class="text-header left-align">MY ROLE</p>
                <p class="text">To help the Innovation Studio establish their working rhythms and digital presence I independently conducted contextual inquiry, persona development for both the internal team and our clients, made agile process recommendations and developed the Innovation Studio web presence. </p>

                <p class="sub-header">CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</p>
                <p class="text">As the Innovation Studio was designed to be a top-tier team solving the most impactful challenges within GE and leading other teams to do the same it was critical that we established our own successful working rhythms. To provide context I conducted research interviews with team members to understand how they work within the teams process and what their pain points were.</p>
                
                 <p class="sub-header">PERSONA DEVELOPMENT</p>
                <p class="text">Based the one the results of the contextual inquiry I created personas for the different team members who make up the Innovation Studio.  This exercise allowed me to see trends in the audience's pain-points, motivations and unmet needs. It also gave me vital insight which led to me being able to make recommendations to improve our own agile process.</p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">AGILE PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                <p class="text">My research led to several discoveries in the way that personas communicate with one another during the lifetime of a user story which caused the team to be less effective.  As a result I was able to propose possible solutions to address these communication shortcomings, including improved team member status indicators, creating team member office hours and tracking reasonable non-project work.</p>
                
                
                 <p class="sub-header">HIGH FIDELITY DESIGN &amp; FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</p>
                <p class="text">Having gained an understanding of the Innovation Studio, its clients and its offerings from my research I was able to translate those insights into a visual design for the Innovation Studio’s web presence. Using Angular, HTML5/CSS3 and Bootstrap I developed the responsive single page application which serves as the Innovation Studio’s face to the world. </p>

                <p class="text">The goal of the Innovation Studio was create a top performing team that could solve some the most impactful employee experience challenges at GE and serve as a model for other project teams looking to incorporate principles of design thinking and agile project management into their projects. As such it was critical that we ourselves were that high performing team GE leadership expected us to be. </p>
                
                <p class="text">To ensure that our process was ready for the spotlight I conducted an introspective round of contextual inquiry into the way that we worked.  I also looked at each of our offerings and how we we might improve the interactions we were having with our customers. </p>
                
                <p class="text">At the same time we also need to start marketing the Innovation Studio to the 500,000+ employees and contractors within GE.  Only with a proper digital strategy would we be able to have the meaningful impact leadership was expecting to come as a result of the formation of the Innovation Studio. This led to me researching, designing, testing and eventually developing the web presence for the Innovation Studio. </p>

                <p class="text">To start the discovery I conducted a round of open ended interviews with each member of the team.  Based on their responses I was able to create three primary personas, a subject authority, a newer team member and a leadership member. </p>

                <p class="text">At this point you might be thinking, what does all of this have to do with UX, it sounds more like I am playing the role of an agile team coach.  While you are correct that I haven’t touched an digital interface yet, this is still a UX research problem.  Given that I was able to take the research and insights from the discovery phase and use that understanding of each user's/team member’s needs, motivations and goals to then translate that data into actionable suggestions.  These suggestions would improve our process, not unlike redesigning a workflow can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a user.  </p>

                <p class="text">The next part of the challenge was to help the Innovation Studio get it’s start in GE by creating a web presence which would serve as the front door to the team. The Innovation Studio was unique within GE because it was it’s own profit and loss team, meaning that the team had to earn the money it used to create solutions, pay employees, etc.  The team also had a unique mandate of “improve the employee experience and the process which other teams fulfill their responsibilities”.   </p>
                
                <p class="text">The Innovation Studio wanted to capture their unique circumstances, as well as, their own collective personality in the design of the Innovation Studio web presence. In order to help define just what that collective personality was we ran an affinity mapping exercise.</p>
